# News App
The goal is to create a News Feed app which gives a user regularly-updated news from the internet 
related to a particular topic, person, or location. 
In this project, use [Guardian API](http://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/). 
This is a well-maintained API which returns information in a JSON format.

### API Key Note
You need to insert your API key.
Go to a file named `Constants.java` and find the value of API_KEY.
Replace "test" with "YOUR-API-KEY".
```
public static final String API_KEY = "YOUR-API-KEY";
```
